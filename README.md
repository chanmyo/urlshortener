# Clojure Github Stats Generator

## Requirements
- Npm or Yarn
- Node 8+

## To Get Started

Run in command line: `TOKEN=[github token] node index`, where "github token" is replaced with a Github Personal Access Token, for testing purposes.

## Notes

For demonstration so that the script runs, we have invoked the function with the arguments 4 (number of repos) and 230 (number of commits to process) i.e. modify to see different results

```test(4, 230)```
